# When building a release, it may be useful to specify the api-key to use inside the project.
# Securing your API keys is an essential step and you should always do it: never commit your
# personal key inside any project. The Google api-key can be requested from the Google Developer
# Console and it is required in order to access Google Maps and Google Drive from within the app.
# The Dropbox api-key can be requested from the Dropbox website, inside the developer section and
# it is used to access the Dropbox storage. The Openexchangerates.org api-key can be requested from
# the official website and it is used to download the updated exchange rate values: if no value is
# specified at build time, the application will let the user to insert his personal api-key at
# runtime inside the application settings.
